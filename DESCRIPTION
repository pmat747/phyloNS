Title: Nested Sampling for phylogenetics
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Patricio Maturana Russel
Maintainer: The package maintainer <p.russel@auckland.ac.nz>
Description: This R package allows the use of Nested Sampling (NS) 
             in phylogenetics for the fixed and variable tree topology cases.
             NS is mainly used to estimate the marginal likelihood, quantity 
             used for model selection under a Bayesian framework, but can 
             also be used to get samples from the posterior distribution.
