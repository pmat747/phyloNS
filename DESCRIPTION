Title: Nested Sampling for phylogenetics

Author: Patricio Maturana Russel

Description: This R package allows the use of Nested Sampling (NS) in 
             phylogenetics for the fixed tree topology case.  NS is mainly used
             to estimate the marginal likelihood, quantity used for model selection 
             under a Bayesian framework, but can also be used to get samples from the 
             posterior distribution.
