phyloNS - R package 

This R package allows the use of Nested Sampling (NS) in phylogenetics for the fixed tree topology case.  NS is mainly used to estimate the marginal likelihood, quantity used for model selection under a Bayesian framework, but can also be used to get samples from the posterior distribution.
